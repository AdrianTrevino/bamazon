Bamazon is an app that allows a user to purchase items from a data base.

It has a way to let the user know what items are for sale and their price.

The app then automatically calculates the price for the user.

The app also keeps track of stock quantity and will let a user know if the product is out of stock.





IN THE FUTURE: There will be a way for a manager to update quantity of stock and view purchases made. The manager will also be able to edit price information.
